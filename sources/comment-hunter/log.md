### Notified

- **@OfficialLoganK** · 58.5× · 324❤ 57💬 in 72m · vel 6.12/min vs author median 0.10 → 58.5×

  - Tweet: Today we are rolling out edit mode in AI Studio Vibe Coding ✏️, select components to quickly edit them, annotate right on the UI with a pen, and select image assets to change them with Nano Banana + upload content! https://t.co/Ct9H98o3iT
  - Suggestion: annotation-on-UI beats text descriptions for grounding — coords collapse component ambiguity fast. what does the model see: full page screenshot with overlay, or just the selected region crop?
  - Reasoning: Picks up the specific annotation feature, adds the missing technical mechanism (spatial grounding vs text, full-frame vs crop context window), and ends with a sharp implementation question that pulls OP into answering.

  - Tweet: > start a new project > open Claude Code > no CLAUDE.md > Claude doesn't know your stack > "can I edit this file?" yes > click Allow 30 times > realize .env was read 5 minutes ago > spend 2 hours configuring everything > start next project > do it all over again from scratch > there's a starter kit that does all of this in 5 minutes
  - Suggestion: the .env read is the real one — ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md as global template + deny rules in ~/.claude/settings.json means every new project inherits them, zero re-clicks
  - Reasoning: Pins on the sharpest concrete pain point (silent .env read), then adds a specific mechanism OP didn't mention (global ~/.claude/ layer) that partially invalidates the "start from scratch" premise — inviting OP and others to push back or confirm.

  - Tweet: "A spokesperson for New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declined to comment on the Israeli real estate expo"
  - Suggestion: no comment from a mayor's office isn't neutral — it's a signal. costs nothing diplomatically, signals disapproval to the base, and keeps deniability if the optics shift.
  - Reasoning: Adds a political-comms mechanism the OP left implicit (strategic silence as low-cost signaling), which invites the OP and readers to agree or push back on the framing — high reply bait.
